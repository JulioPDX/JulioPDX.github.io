## Introduction

I recently went down the rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards and even worse, attempting to build my own. I hope this blog shows you some random dudes journey to building his first mechanical keyboard and hopefully avoid some of the mistakes I made. I hope you enjoy the blog and thank you for visiting the site.

## Why build a keyboard vs buy

Why would you build a keyboard? I mean, you could just buy one right? That is totally correct and there's absolutely nothing wrong with buying a keyboard or mechanical keyboard pre-assembled. In fact, two other keyboards I own came pre-assembled. One being the Keyboardio Atreus (still use this for travel) and the Iris keyboard I purchased from Keebio. Both are excellent and I still use them today.

Even though I purchased two previous sets, I kept wondering if I could build one of these myself. I compare it to the same journey of putting a puzzle together, a Lego set, or a Gundam kit. Something about building something and seeing it come together brings a vast amount of joy.

## Why ortholinear

If you clicked on the previous links for the two keyboards mentioned above, you might be thinking "why do those keyboards look so weird?" Fair question. These keyboards use an ortholinear layout where all the keys are the same size and have a uniform grid vs a staggered layout found in traditional keyboards. The thought being this replicates the natural movement of our fingers, although, from my reading, there isn't any scientific evidence that this improves the typing experience or leads to less wrist injuries.

## Why split

At this point we have an ortholinear keyboard with a uniform grid, but if you clicked on the Iris keyboard, you may notice that its split into two pieces, basically in half of a traditional keyboard. The major benefit here, since we have two unique pieces, we can rotate them to align with the natural resting position of our wrists vs angling our wrists inward to align with a traditional staggered layout.

## Picking the right keyboard

On this journey I was now set on a split keyboard with an ortholinear layout. This is where it gets fun or tricky. There are so many options in the world of mechanical keyboards and it feels like any portion of the build can be customized to fit your needs. The layout, materials, key switches, keycaps, and colors for everything. It can get overwhelming very fast.

I had some general points to follow to make the selection process as easy as possible. This is in no particular order, just whatever comes to mind.

1. Wood case or at least wood filled filament option
2. Tactile switches
3. Split layout
4. Compact

I honestly cant remember how I found my final choice but I'm happy I did. Have you ever found a thing that just makes you say "this fits me." When I saw the Minidox for the first time I knew that was the keyboard I wanted to build. The Minidox is a more compact version of the popular ErgoDox. The PCB for the Minidox was created by That-Canadian and I cant thank them enough for making this free and open source for the community.

## Assembling the required tools

I'll provide links to the items I used but feel free to source what works for you. You may have some items that I didnt have when I started and I basically had none of them.

1. Soldering iron kit (Highly recommend, comes with solder, solder pump, and more)
2. PCB and electronics from
