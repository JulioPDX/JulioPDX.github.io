      <title>RPKI in the Lab</title>

      <description>Introduction I was recently finished the last chapters of Optimal Routing Design (great read). One of the chapters covered routing protocol security with protocols such as BGP, EIGRP, and OSPF. This echoed something in my head regarding Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). I knew the book&amp;rsquo;s printing was around 2003 and figured RPKI wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the book. This led me to wonder if I could get RPKI running in the lab, and the following blog post details some of that journey.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few weeks ago, a co-worker asked the team if there was a way to convert a set of Markdown files produced from the AVD Ansible Collection to nice HTML. I then created a simple GitHub Repo that explored various ways to build HTML from Markdown. That repository is combined with the example we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through in this blog.
I then went down the rabbit hole of getting a static site deployed in the various Clouds.</description>

      <description>Introduction A while back, I was building a technical presentation. Like most presentations, this would include diagrams, code blocks, images, etc. So I did what any of us usually did and looked at something like Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint.
For the longest time, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of how code blocks looked in these presentations or the gymnastics performed when taking a screenshot of some highlighted code or opening another app to create an image that would then be added to the presentation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out another blog post. All the support for the blog has been tremendous and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank you all enough. Packet Pushers invited me to write on their platform and it&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure working with Drew and team. If you would like to check those out, I will link them at the end of this post! Today we will focus on an interesting tool in the community, Netreplica, but specifically Graphite.</description>

      <description>Intro I was recently working my way through Optimal Routing design by Cisco Press&amp;hellip; Can you tell that I get through books very slowly? I&amp;rsquo;ve probably used that sentence in my blog posts three or four times now! Either way, this chapter focused on scaling BGP and dealing with external connections. The section that really got me was external connections. The books goes over a lot, for example, handling inbound traffic, outbound traffic, full routes vs partial vs default.</description>

      <title>Network Simulation Tools and Containerlab</title>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been progressing through a series of technical books, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve shared on other blogs. A few of them focus on BGP. BGP being so broad, I decided to create a challenge lab. Creating the challenge/troubleshooting labs has really made more concepts stick. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to use the principle of teaching someone to make the learning last. These have been incredibly fun to create and the community interaction has been amazing.</description>

      <title>Learning Labs With Containerlab</title>

      <description>Hello everyone and thank you for checking in. I’m back with another post. To be honest this one is not the norm as it will just redirect you to a project I’ve been working on with Containerlab. I’m still progressing through the Optimal Routing Design book by Cisco Press. I still haven’t finished the OSPF chapter but little by little.
A while back I mentioned that Containerlab could be an amazing resource in learning environments for individuals getting into IT or instructors trying to show students some routing design or technology involved.</description>

      <description>Introduction I just finished the chapter on EIGRP network design in Optimal Routing Design (Cisco Press), I wanted to provide a high level overview of what I learned and incorporated that in the lab. This book really has been great as it provides advanced routing techniques but keeps it in a maintainable format. I hope you enjoy the post and learn something along the way. I would advise you to research on your own and compare the pros and cons.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve been working my way through Optimal Routing Design by Russ White, Don Slice, and Alvaro Retana. It has been a great read so far and I highly recommend it. When I work through a book I usually try and lab up any concept I can, this helps me make it stick as much as possible. Early on in the book the authors mention redistribution and possible issues that can come with doing it at more than one point in the network.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello and thank you for tuning in to another episode. First off, I was recently notified that this blog made it to the Cisco IT Blog Awards final! Pretty wild to think about, but thank you to all those involved. This one is definitely going to be different and out of my comfort zone and I appreciate you sticking with me.
I have been working through the Introduction to Computer Science course by CS50x (Harvard).</description>
