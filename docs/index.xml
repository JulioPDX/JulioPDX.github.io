      <description>Intro I recently had a use case where I needed a list of IP addresses from a prefix. My first step was to go through Ansible documentation on current filters to see if something would match my need. Long story short, there wasnâ€™t. At least, nothing I could find which honestly is probably a huge possibility, and in that case this post is pointless. Ansible does have IP address filters but I noticed most all of the examples assume you already have a list of IP addresses to pass to the filters.</description>
