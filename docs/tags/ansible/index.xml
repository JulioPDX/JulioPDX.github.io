      <description>Introduction Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since my last blog post. I recently attended the first AutoCon event focusing on network automation. Long story short, it was terrific. Check it out and be on the lookout for the next one. Shortly after AutoCon, two community members sprung up with sweet blog posts. My colleague and friend Dan Hertzberg are resurrecting the blog. The first post went over leveraging ygot to create Go structs.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been progressing through a series of technical books, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve shared on other blogs. A few of them focus on BGP. BGP being so broad, I decided to create a challenge lab. Creating the challenge/troubleshooting labs has really made more concepts stick. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to use the principle of teaching someone to make the learning last. These have been incredibly fun to create and the community interaction has been amazing.</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out this post. This is going to be a special one. Due to the fact that I had such a joy using this new tool (new to me). I don’t like to over hype tools or new things just to hype it up. There are times where a tool or technology does deserve the credit and time in the limelight. I think Containerlabs is one of those tools.</description>

      <title>Creating List of IP Addresses With Ansible Filter Plugin</title>

      <description>Intro I recently had a use case where I needed a list of IP addresses from a prefix. My first step was to go through Ansible documentation on current filters to see if something would match my need. Long story short, there wasn’t. At least, nothing I could find which honestly is probably a huge possibility, and in that case this post is pointless. Ansible does have IP address filters but I noticed most all of the examples assume you already have a list of IP addresses to pass to the filters.</description>
