      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out this post. This is going to be a special one. Due to the fact that I had such a joy using this new tool (new to me). I don’t like to over hype tools or new things just to hype it up. There are times where a tool or technology does deserve the credit and time in the limelight. I think Containerlabs is one of those tools.</description>

      <description>Intro I recently had a use case where I needed a list of IP addresses from a prefix. My first step was to go through Ansible documentation on current filters to see if something would match my need. Long story short, there wasn’t. At least, nothing I could find which honestly is probably a huge possibility, and in that case this post is pointless. Ansible does have IP address filters but I noticed most all of the examples assume you already have a list of IP addresses to pass to the filters.</description>
