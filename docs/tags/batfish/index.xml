      <description>Introduction Hello everyone and thank you for checking out part four in this series. I went on vacation for a bit, but I’m glad to be back on the keys. In this post I will break down all of the steps performed before a change hits our network devices. This is important because we have the opportunity to stop incorrect or invalid configurations from ever hitting our network devices. A few steps that we will cover are: Black for code formatting, Batfish to validate configuration updates, and NAPALM dry run for testing the legitimacy of the configuration files.</description>
