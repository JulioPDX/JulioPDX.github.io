      <description>Introduction Hello all and thank you for checking out another one of my blog posts. It really means a lot. I recently completed the Cisco ENARSI exam after a few months of studying. It was honestly pretty difficult for me but the pass was worth it! I may have to write a blog post on studying for and passing that exam. In this post I will break down how I automated some parts of an MPLS L3VPN deployment.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello and thank you for joining me in another blog post. I’ve wanted to mess with getting a bot running on Slack for a while now. After coming across a fantastic post by Mason Egger at Digital Ocean (linked at the end), I figured now is as good a time as any. Think of that post as a prerequisite to get you started before following along with this one.</description>

      <title>Network Validation With Nornir &amp; Napalm</title>

      <description>Intro I wanted to get my feet wet with Nornir/NAPALM and Python network automation in general. One simple goal to start with in network automation is validating configurations or deploying “show commands” and returning some kind of useful information. I wanted to start with something very simple, as easy wins make me want to keep progressing. In this post I will break down how I validate SNMP information on network devices using Nornir and NAPALM.</description>

      <title>Creating List of IP Addresses With Ansible Filter Plugin</title>

      <description>Intro I recently had a use case where I needed a list of IP addresses from a prefix. My first step was to go through Ansible documentation on current filters to see if something would match my need. Long story short, there wasn’t. At least, nothing I could find which honestly is probably a huge possibility, and in that case this post is pointless. Ansible does have IP address filters but I noticed most all of the examples assume you already have a list of IP addresses to pass to the filters.</description>
