      <description>Introduction Hello everyone and thank you for checking out another blog post. This time looking at testing the network. In my previous post, I mentioned testing could be a really neat and much needed addition to the code base. I had some spare time this weekend and couldn’t wait. Ill be honest, I consider myself a novice in python and programming in general. There is definitely many ways to accomplish a task and I’m sure there are plenty of more efficient ways to perform the actions I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello all and thank you for checking out another one of my blog posts. It really means a lot. I recently completed the Cisco ENARSI exam after a few months of studying. It was honestly pretty difficult for me but the pass was worth it! I may have to write a blog post on studying for and passing that exam. In this post I will break down how I automated some parts of an MPLS L3VPN deployment.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello and thank you for checking out this post. I was recently working through OSPF and EIGRP for ENARSI studies and something came up on a lab I was building. Redistributing routes between OSPFv3 and EIGRPv6. I am specifically speaking of the IPv6 variant of these protocols.
In the topology you see below. We have three routing devices. One running only EIGRPv6, one running OSPFv3 (Aruba CX), and the redistribution node running both protocols.</description>

      <title>Simple Radius Server in EVE-NG</title>

      <description>Introduction I was recently going through an advanced routing course on Pluralsight by Nick Russo, great course by the way. Check it out HERE. During the course we inevitably get to the services portion. The portion most of us dread as network engineers. This is all the extra stuff. Where the routing and switching might be the sexy topic, services is arguably not that exciting… but very much necessary.
If we are in the process of testing AAA, we will need some form of TACACS or RADIUS server.</description>

      <title>Automating Multi Vendor Environments With Netmiko</title>

      <description>Introduction Hello again! I was working through Nick Russos’ awesome Automating Networks with Python course on Pluralsight, check it out HERE. In the course, Nick does a great job of breaking down the code and the functionality of each bit. I’m still doing a lot of leaning in Python so please bear with me.
The course uses an MPLS environment as an example of network automation with Python. I decided to use the principles taught in the Netmiko portion of the course to try and automate some OSPF between multiple vendors.</description>
