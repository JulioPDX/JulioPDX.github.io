      <title>RPKI in the Lab</title>

      <description>Introduction I recently finished the last chapters of Optimal Routing Design (great read). One of the chapters covered routing protocol security with protocols such as BGP, EIGRP, and OSPF. This echoed something in my head regarding Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). I knew the book&amp;rsquo;s printing was around 2003 and figured RPKI wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the book. This led me to wonder if I could get RPKI running in the lab, and the following blog post details some of that journey.</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out another blog post. All the support for the blog has been tremendous and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank you all enough. Packet Pushers invited me to write on their platform and it&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure working with Drew and team. If you would like to check those out, I will link them at the end of this post! Today we will focus on an interesting tool in the community, Netreplica, but specifically Graphite.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been progressing through a series of technical books, some of which I&amp;rsquo;ve shared on other blogs. A few of them focus on BGP. BGP being so broad, I decided to create a challenge lab. Creating the challenge/troubleshooting labs has really made more concepts stick. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to use the principle of teaching someone to make the learning last. These have been incredibly fun to create and the community interaction has been amazing.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve been working my way through Optimal Routing Design by Russ White, Don Slice, and Alvaro Retana. It has been a great read so far and I highly recommend it. When I work through a book I usually try and lab up any concept I can, this helps me make it stick as much as possible. Early on in the book the authors mention redistribution and possible issues that can come with doing it at more than one point in the network.</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out this post. This is going to be a special one. Due to the fact that I had such a joy using this new tool (new to me). I don’t like to over hype tools or new things just to hype it up. There are times where a tool or technology does deserve the credit and time in the limelight. I think Containerlabs is one of those tools.</description>
