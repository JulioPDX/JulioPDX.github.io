      <description>Introduction Hello again! I was working through Nick Russos’ awesome Automating Networks with Python course on Pluralsight, check it out HERE. In the course, Nick does a great job of breaking down the code and the functionality of each bit. I’m still doing a lot of leaning in Python so please bear with me.
The course uses an MPLS environment as an example of network automation with Python. I decided to use the principles taught in the Netmiko portion of the course to try and automate some OSPF between multiple vendors.</description>

      <description>Intro I wanted to get my feet wet with Nornir/NAPALM and Python network automation in general. One simple goal to start with in network automation is validating configurations or deploying “show commands” and returning some kind of useful information. I wanted to start with something very simple, as easy wins make me want to keep progressing. In this post I will break down how I validate SNMP information on network devices using Nornir and NAPALM.</description>

      <title>Creating List of IP Addresses With Ansible Filter Plugin</title>

      <description>Intro I recently had a use case where I needed a list of IP addresses from a prefix. My first step was to go through Ansible documentation on current filters to see if something would match my need. Long story short, there wasn’t. At least, nothing I could find which honestly is probably a huge possibility, and in that case this post is pointless. Ansible does have IP address filters but I noticed most all of the examples assume you already have a list of IP addresses to pass to the filters.</description>
