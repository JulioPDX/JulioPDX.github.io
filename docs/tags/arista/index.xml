      <description>Introduction Two blogs in one year. Who do I think I am? In all seriousness, thank you for all the feedback on the previous blog. As always, it really means a lot. This one might go a bit sideways, but building something like this has always been on my mind, and I got another spark to get it done while attending AutoCon2.
I caught the first half of a talk by Mircea Ulinic from Digitial Ocean.</description>

      <description>Introduction Can you believe it&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since my last blog? It&amp;rsquo;s incredible how fast time flies. Thank you all for continuing to read the blog and sharing it with engineers in the community. I can&amp;rsquo;t thank you enough for all the support and encouragement I&amp;rsquo;ve received on this journey.
This blog is going to take a bit of a turn. I usually write in the form of a tool I have used or been presented with and think, &amp;ldquo;This is incredible; more people should know about it.</description>

      <title>RPKI in the Lab</title>

      <description>Introduction I recently finished the last chapters of Optimal Routing Design (great read). One of the chapters covered routing protocol security with protocols such as BGP, EIGRP, and OSPF. This echoed something in my head regarding Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). I knew the book&amp;rsquo;s printing was around 2003 and figured RPKI wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in the book. This led me to wonder if I could get RPKI running in the lab, and the following blog post details some of that journey.</description>

      <description>Intro I was recently working my way through Optimal Routing design by Cisco Press&amp;hellip; Can you tell that I get through books very slowly? I&amp;rsquo;ve probably used that sentence in my blog posts three or four times now! Either way, this chapter focused on scaling BGP and dealing with external connections. The section that really got me was external connections. The books goes over a lot, for example, handling inbound traffic, outbound traffic, full routes vs partial vs default.</description>

      <description>Introduction I recently saw a fellow engineer share an amazing article on Real Python. It was a post by Sebastián Ramírez, the creator of FastAPI. I’m fairly comfortable working with APIs but I’ve never even thought about making one. The prospect seems so daunting, especially when I’m still trying to master the foundational skills of python. FastAPI does a ton of heavy lifting to make this process incredibly easy to get started and build web APIs.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello again! I was working through Nick Russos’ awesome Automating Networks with Python course on Pluralsight, check it out HERE. In the course, Nick does a great job of breaking down the code and the functionality of each bit. I’m still doing a lot of leaning in Python so please bear with me.
The course uses an MPLS environment as an example of network automation with Python. I decided to use the principles taught in the Netmiko portion of the course to try and automate some OSPF between multiple vendors.</description>
