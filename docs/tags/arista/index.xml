      <description>Introduction I recently saw a fellow engineer share an amazing article on Real Python. It was a post by Sebastián Ramírez, the creator of FastAPI. I’m fairly comfortable working with APIs but I’ve never even thought about making one. The prospect seems so daunting, especially when I’m still trying to master the foundational skills of python. FastAPI does a ton of heavy lifting to make this process incredibly easy to get started and build web APIs.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello again! I was working through Nick Russos’ awesome Automating Networks with Python course on Pluralsight, check it out HERE. In the course, Nick does a great job of breaking down the code and the functionality of each bit. I’m still doing a lot of leaning in Python so please bear with me.
The course uses an MPLS environment as an example of network automation with Python. I decided to use the principles taught in the Netmiko portion of the course to try and automate some OSPF between multiple vendors.</description>
