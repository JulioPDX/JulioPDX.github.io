      <description>Introduction Can you believe it&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since my last blog? It&amp;rsquo;s incredible how fast time flies. Thank you all for continuing to read the blog and sharing it with engineers in the community. I can&amp;rsquo;t thank you enough for all the support and encouragement I&amp;rsquo;ve received on this journey.
This blog is going to take a bit of a turn. I usually write in the form of a tool I have used or been presented with and think, &amp;ldquo;This is incredible; more people should know about it.</description>
