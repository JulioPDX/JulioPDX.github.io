      <description>Introduction Thank you for checking out part three in this series, it really means a lot! So far we have installed Docker on an Ubuntu host machine and the Drone server/runners. In this post we will go over the .drone.yml file and why I decided to create my first Docker container image. Stick around after the breakâ€¦. who am I kidding there is no break, what is this an infomercial?</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you for checking out part two of this series. The last post went through installing docker on an Ubuntu server to begin our journey to building a CI/CD pipeline. In this post it will be all about connecting Drone to our code repository, in this case GitHub. From our reference diagram below, we will be focusing on the connections from GitHub to the Drone runners.
The Pipeline Server and Runners Now that we have docker installed, we need something to test our code or execute it.</description>
