      <description>Introduction Thank you for checking out part two of this series. The last post went through installing docker on an Ubuntu server to begin our journey to building a CI/CD pipeline. In this post it will be all about connecting Drone to our code repository, in this case GitHub. From our reference diagram below, we will be focusing on the connections from GitHub to the Drone runners.
The Pipeline Server and Runners Now that we have docker installed, we need something to test our code or execute it.</description>

This pipeline is not perfect and I’m sure there’s much more efficient ways to produce the same outcomes. I did make the choice to leave out a few things as the technologies involved and complexity kept growing.</description>
