      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out another blog post. All the support for the blog has been tremendous and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank you all enough. Packet Pushers invited me to write on their platform and it&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure working with Drew and team. If you would like to check those out, I will link them at the end of this post! Today we will focus on an interesting tool in the community, Netreplica, but specifically Graphite.</description>
