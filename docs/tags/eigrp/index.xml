      <description>Introduction I just finished the chapter on EIGRP network design in Optimal Routing Design (Cisco Press), I wanted to provide a high level overview of what I learned and incorporated that in the lab. This book really has been great as it provides advanced routing techniques but keeps it in a maintainable format. I hope you enjoy the post and learn something along the way. I would advise you to research on your own and compare the pros and cons.</description>
