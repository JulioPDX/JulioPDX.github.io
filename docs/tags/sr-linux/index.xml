      <description>Intro I was recently working my way through Optimal Routing design by Cisco Press&amp;hellip; Can you tell that I get through books very slowly? I&amp;rsquo;ve probably used that sentence in my blog posts three or four times now! Either way, this chapter focused on scaling BGP and dealing with external connections. The section that really got me was external connections. The books goes over a lot, for example, handling inbound traffic, outbound traffic, full routes vs partial vs default.</description>

      <description>Introduction Iâ€™ve been working my way through Optimal Routing Design by Russ White, Don Slice, and Alvaro Retana. It has been a great read so far and I highly recommend it. When I work through a book I usually try and lab up any concept I can, this helps me make it stick as much as possible. Early on in the book the authors mention redistribution and possible issues that can come with doing it at more than one point in the network.</description>
