      <description>Introduction Hello and thank you for tuning in. Just for clarity, the 4x4x48 challenge was created by David Goggins. The challenge requires participants to run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. Participants are allowed to substitute running with walking or general exercise. The main goal is to get people moving as well as donate to charity!
The next thought may be why the hell would someone want to run 48 miles on a perfectly nice weekend?</description>
