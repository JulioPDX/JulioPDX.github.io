      <description>Introduction I recently went down the rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards and, even worse, attempted to build my own. This blog will show you some random dude&amp;rsquo;s journey to making his first mechanical keyboard and avoiding some of my mistakes. I hope you enjoy the blog, and thank you for visiting the site.
