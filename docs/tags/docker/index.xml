      <description>Introduction Thank you all for checking out this post. This is going to be a special one. Due to the fact that I had such a joy using this new tool (new to me). I don’t like to over hype tools or new things just to hype it up. There are times where a tool or technology does deserve the credit and time in the limelight. I think Containerlabs is one of those tools.</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you for checking out part three in this series, it really means a lot! So far we have installed Docker on an Ubuntu host machine and the Drone server/runners. In this post we will go over the .drone.yml file and why I decided to create my first Docker container image. Stick around after the break…. who am I kidding there is no break, what is this an infomercial?</description>

      <description>Introduction Thank you for checking out part two of this series. The last post went through installing docker on an Ubuntu server to begin our journey to building a CI/CD pipeline. In this post it will be all about connecting Drone to our code repository, in this case GitHub. From our reference diagram below, we will be focusing on the connections from GitHub to the Drone runners.
The Pipeline Server and Runners Now that we have docker installed, we need something to test our code or execute it.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello all and thank you for joining me on another blog post! In this post or series of posts I hope to walk you through my journey on building a network CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline is not perfect and I’m sure there’s much more efficient ways to produce the same outcomes. I did make the choice to leave out a few things as the technologies involved and complexity kept growing.</description>
